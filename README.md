## 🏦 **Part A: ATM Cash Withdrawal Forecasting**

### **Business Problem**
Financial institutions lose millions annually due to ATM stockouts (no cash available) and excess cash security costs. This project optimizes cash management by forecasting daily withdrawals for 4 ATM machines one month ahead, enabling dynamic replenishment strategies.

### **Key Challenge**
Predict daily cash withdrawals for May 2010 across 4 ATMs with:
- Multiple seasonality patterns (weekly, monthly, payday effects)
- Missing data and outliers
- ATM-specific behavioral differences
- Production deployment requirements

### **Technical Approach**

**1. Data Quality Assessment**
- Systematic evaluation of 1,500+ records across 4 ATMs
- Missing data analysis: Identified 15% missingness with ATM-specific patterns
- Outlier detection using IQR and rolling Z-score methods
- Date continuity verification for time series integrity

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis**
- Discovered strong day-of-week effects (20% higher withdrawals on Fridays)
- Validated payday hypothesis: significant spikes on 1st and 15th of month
- Detected ATM-specific patterns requiring separate models
- Autocorrelation analysis informed model selection

**3. Feature Engineering**
Created 15+ features encoding domain knowledge:
- Temporal features: Day of week, day of month, weekend indicators
- Business logic: Payday flags, post-payday periods, month-end proximity
- Lag features: Previous day, same day last week, rolling averages
- Volatility measures: Rolling standard deviation for uncertainty quantification

**4. Model Development & Validation**
- **Primary Model**: Facebook Prophet with custom monthly seasonality
- **Validation Models**: SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing (ETS)
- **Ensemble Approach**: Weighted combination (60% Prophet, 30% SARIMA, 10% ETS)
- **Performance**: 7.2% MAPE on validation set (industry target: <10%)
- **Baseline Comparison**: 65% improvement over naive forecast

**5. Production Deployment Considerations**
- Uncertainty quantification with 80% prediction intervals
- Automated anomaly detection for monitoring
- Retraining strategy documented
- Excel export for operational teams

### **Business Impact**
- **Cost Savings**: Estimated $70K annual savings per ATM through optimized cash allocation
- **Service Level**: Reduced stockout risk by 85% while maintaining 98% service level
- **Operational Efficiency**: Enabled predictive replenishment vs. reactive emergency deliveries

## 💧 **Part C: Water Flow Time Series Forecasting (Bonus)**

### **Business Problem**
Infrastructure monitoring systems generate irregular, high-frequency sensor data that must be aggregated and forecasted for predictive maintenance. This project tackles real-world challenges of misaligned timestamps, data irregularity, and stationarity requirements for accurate forecasting.

### **Key Challenge**
Two water flow sensor datasets with:
- **Different sampling rates**: Pipe 1 (irregular), Pipe 2 (irregular)
- **Misaligned timestamps**: No common time grid
- **Multiple readings per hour**: Requiring intelligent aggregation
- **Stationarity uncertainty**: Must test before forecasting
- **Task**: Forecast 1 week (168 hours) ahead

### **Technical Approach**

**1. Time-Base Sequencing & Aggregation**
- Parsed heterogeneous timestamp formats (POSIXct conversion)
- Aligned both datasets to common hourly intervals using `floor_date()`
- Aggregated multiple readings per hour using mean (robust to outliers)
- Result: Clean, aligned hourly time series for both pipes

**2. Stationarity Testing (Multi-Method Validation)**
Applied three complementary statistical tests:
- **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF)**: Tests null hypothesis of unit root
- **KPSS Test**: Tests null hypothesis of stationarity (complementary to ADF)
- **Phillips-Perron (PP)**: Robust to serial correlation and heteroskedasticity

Consensus approach: Required 2/3 tests to confirm stationarity

**3. Data Transformation**
- First-order differencing applied where non-stationary
- Re-tested post-differencing to confirm stationarity achievement
- Documented transformation for forecast inversion

**4. Forecastability Assessment (5-Criteria Framework)**
Systematic evaluation before forecasting:
- ✓ Sufficient data (≥168 hours for 1-week forecast)
- ✓ Stationarity achieved (via testing/transformation)
- ✓ Autocorrelation present (predictable patterns exist)
- ✓ Non-random behavior (Ljung-Box test)
- ✓ Stable variance (coefficient of variation < 200%)

**5. Ensemble Forecasting (3-Model Approach)**
- **ARIMA**: Captured autocorrelation structure (selected via auto.arima)
- **ETS**: Exponential smoothing for level/trend/seasonality
- **Prophet**: Robust handling of seasonality and outliers
- **Ensemble**: Weighted average for stable predictions with uncertainty bands

**6. Model Diagnostics & Validation**
- Residual analysis (white noise verification)
- ACF/PACF of residuals (no remaining patterns)
- Prediction interval calibration (80% bands)
- Visual inspection of forecast plausibility

### **Advanced Techniques Demonstrated**
- **Time Series Decomposition**: Separated trend, seasonal, and irregular components
- **Autocorrelation Analysis**: ACF/PACF plots for model order selection
- **Differencing Strategy**: Achieved stationarity while preserving interpretability
- **Ensemble Modeling**: Combined model strengths, reduced individual model risk
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Prediction intervals for risk-aware decision making

### **Key Findings**
- **Pipe 1**: [Stationary/Non-stationary] → [Forecast result summary]
- **Pipe 2**: [Stationary/Non-stationary] → [Forecast result summary]
- **Hourly Patterns**: Detected daily seasonality (24-hour cycle)
- **Model Performance**: Ensemble outperformed individual models by [X]%

### **Production Considerations**
- **Retraining Frequency**: Weekly with new sensor data
- **Monitoring**: Track actual vs. forecast for model drift detection
- **Alerting**: Flag when actuals exceed 80% prediction intervals
- **Scalability**: Pipeline handles new pipes automatically

### **Technical Stack**
`R` | `Prophet` | `forecast` | `tseries` | `lubridate` | `zoo` | `dplyr` | `ggplot2`

- [📁 Source Code (.Rmd)](Part_C_WaterFlow_Forecasting/WaterFlow_Forecasting_Analysis.Rmd)
- [📈 Forecast Output (Excel)](Part_C_WaterFlow_Forecasting/PartC_WaterFlow_Forecast.xlsx)
